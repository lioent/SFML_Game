# Introduction

This project is a SFML game developed in C++ for academic purposes.


# Getting started

In order to build and compile the project, you need [SFML-2.5.1 and GCC 7.3.0 MinGW (DW2) 32-bit (for Windows)](https://www.sfml-dev.org/files/SFML-2.5.1-windows-gcc-7.3.0-mingw-32-bit.zip), although the SFML dependencies are already included in this GitHub repository. It is also useful to have [Git Bash (for Windows)](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed as well.

After you have everything set up, open a console in the build directory and run `mingw32-make` command. That should generate an executable file in your build folder.
